A powerful and flexible container library for C++ programming.

## About

`zxx::core::container` is a part of `core` library, and the core library is part of `zxx` library. This library provides a wide range of container types, including `darray`, `list`, `map`, `unordered_map`, `set`, `unordered_set`, `stack`, `queue`, `priority_queue`, and more. Each container is designed to be efficient, easy to use, and fully customizable.

## Description

The `zxx::core::container` library offers a wide range of container types, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, `darray` is ideal for situations where you need a dynamic array with a fast random-access time, while `list` is better suited for situations where you need a linked list with fast insertion and deletion times. `map` and `unordered_map` provide an efficient way to store key-value pairs, while `set` and `unordered_set` provide an efficient way to store unique elements.

The library also includes several specialized containers, such as `stack`, `queue`, and `priority_queue`, which are useful in specific situations. All of the containers are designed to be easy to use and fully customizable, so you can use them in a variety of different contexts.

## Features

[`xstl`]() is a portable extension to [the Standard Template Library (STL)](), providing modern and flexible solutions to everyday programming needs. The library is designed to be compatible with C++11 and later standards, with optimal performance when compiled with C++20.

### Portable and Compatible

[`xstl`]() has been extensively tested on a wide range of operating systems, compiler vendors, and C++ standards, ensuring compatibility and seamless integration with your projects. You won't have to worry about compatibility issues with different compilers.

### Easy Installation and Customization

Installing [`xstl`]() is simple and straightforward, with a user-friendly installation interface that allows you to customize how the library is installed and used. You can install the library using package managers or install specific components with the name `xstl-<component_name>`.

### Flexible Build Options

Building [`xstl`]() from source is an easy and flexible process, with well-documented steps to ensure a smooth experience. You will not need to do a ton of googling or *"bing-ing"* (it's 2023, who knows) to fix errors.

The library provides the ability to include only the specific components you need, such as the [container](https://github.com/zaki-x86/xstl-container) or [algorithm](https://github.com/zaki-x86/xstl-algorithm) libraries, without building the entire library. No compiler warnings are produced during the build process.

### Comprehensive Documentation

The library comes with [comprehensive documentation](), providing easy-to-read explanations and plenty of examples to illustrate usage and best practices.

### Readable Source Code

Reading the source code of the standard library is usually a traumatic experience, however, apart from the annoying endless underscores that are attached to variable names `_____var !!!`, the source code of [`xstl`]() is well-documented and easy to read, making it accessible even for new programmers. The source code is well-structured, avoiding the headaches typically associated with the Standard Library's source code.

### Simple Integration

Integrating xstl into your projects is effortless, as it has the same interface as the Standard Library. Simply switch to using the `xstl` namespace instead, and enjoy additional functionalities and features that are not available in the Standard Library.

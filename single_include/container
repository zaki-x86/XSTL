 * @brief A meta container: the container of all the STL containers
 * 
 * Using this head is optional and it was separated from the include folder for a reason,
 * which is because it is large, sense it contains all headers of STL in a single header 
 * file. If your app, or library allow the luxury of having a large executable file,
 * or you're planning on using all STL containers anyway, then you can include this header
 * file without worrying about anything else.
